<h1>Oriented area of a triangle</h1>

<blockquote>Most commonly used geometry technology can easily handle the area of general polygons, given by a sequence of points in the plane, 
  without ever considering convexity or self-intersection. The way they do this is by using formulas that assign to each triangle an "algebraic area,
  " which is the usual area if the triangle is oriented in a counterclockwise matter, and the negative of that area if the triangle is oriented clockwise.
   It is worth noting that this choice of sign is completely arbitrary: things would work just as well if the opposite convention were chosen.</blockquote>
